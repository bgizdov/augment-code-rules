# Documentation Rules

1. **Keep README.md minimal**: Use only README.md in the project root with a brief description including:
   - Project overview
   - Dependencies
   - Key features
   - Setup/installation instructions
   - How to run the project
   - How to deploy
   - Only include the most important information

2. **Don't over-document**: Do not create documentation for every change in the project. Documentation should be created only when necessary for understanding the project.

3. **Organize additional docs**: Create new documentation files in the `docs/` directory if requested by the user. Keep the project root clean with only README.md, AGENTS.md, and CLAUDE.md (when applicable).

4. **Never create unsolicited docs**: Do not proactively create documentation files unless explicitly requested by the user.
