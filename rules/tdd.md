# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Follow TDD principles when implementing features:

1. **Write tests first**: Write tests before implementing the feature or fix
2. **Red-Green-Refactor cycle**:
   - Red: Write a failing test
   - Green: Write minimal code to make the test pass
   - Refactor: Improve the code while keeping tests passing
3. **Test coverage**: Ensure adequate test coverage for new functionality
4. **Run tests frequently**: Execute tests after each change to catch regressions early
5. **Update existing tests**: When modifying existing code, update related tests to reflect the changes
